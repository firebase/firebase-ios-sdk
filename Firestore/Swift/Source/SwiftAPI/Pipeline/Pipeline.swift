/// The `Pipeline` class provides a flexible and expressive framework for building complex data
/// transformation and query pipelines for Firestore.
///
/// A pipeline takes data sources, such as Firestore collections or collection groups, and applies
/// a series of stages that are chained together. Each stage takes the output from the previous
/// stage
/// (or the data source) and produces an output for the next stage (or as the final output of the
/// pipeline).
///
/// Expressions can be used within each stage to filter and transform data through the stage.
///
/// NOTE: The chained stages do not prescribe exactly how Firestore will execute the pipeline.
/// Instead, Firestore only guarantees that the result is the same as if the chained stages were
/// executed in order.
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// The following examples assume you have a `Firestore` instance named `db`.
///
/// ```swift
/// import FirebaseFirestore
///
/// // Example 1: Select specific fields and rename 'rating' to 'bookRating'.
/// // Assumes `Field("rating").as("bookRating")` is a valid `Selectable` expression.
/// do {
/// let snapshot1 = try await db.pipeline().collection("books")
/// .select(Field("title"), Field("author"), Field("rating").as("bookRating"))
/// .execute()
/// print("Results 1: \(snapshot1.results)")
/// } catch {
/// print("Error in example 1: \(error)")
/// }
///
/// // Example 2: Filter documents where 'genre' is "Science Fiction" and 'published' is after 1950.
/// do {
/// let snapshot2 = try await db.pipeline().collection("books")
/// .where(
/// Field("genre").equal("Science Fiction")
/// && Field("published").greaterThan(1950)
/// )
/// .execute()
/// print("Results 2: \(snapshot2.results)")
/// } catch {
/// print("Error in example 2: \(error)")
/// }
///
/// // Example 3: Calculate the average rating of books published after 1980.
/// do {
/// let snapshot3 = try await db.pipeline().collection("books")
/// .where(Field("published").greaterThan(1980))
/// .aggregate(Field("rating").average().as("averageRating"))
/// .execute()
/// print("Results 3: \(snapshot3.results)")
/// } catch {
/// print("Error in example 3: \(error)")
/// }
/// ```
