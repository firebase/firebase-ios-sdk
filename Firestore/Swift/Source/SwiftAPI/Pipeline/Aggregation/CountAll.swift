/// Represents an aggregation that counts all documents in the input set.

/// `CountAll` is used within the `aggregate` pipeline stage to get the total number of documents

/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// // Count all books in the collection
/// firestore.pipeline()
///   .collection("books")
///   .aggregate([
///     CountAll().as("totalBooks")
///   ])
///
/// // Count all sci-fi books published after 1960
/// firestore.pipeline()
///   .collection("books")
///   .where(Field("genre").equal("Science Fiction") && Field("published").greaterThan(1960))
///   .aggregate([
///     CountAll().as("sciFiBooksCount")
///   ])
/// ```
