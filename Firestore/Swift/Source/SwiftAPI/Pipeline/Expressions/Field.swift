/// A `Field` is an `Expression` that represents a field in a Firestore document.
///
/// It is a central component for building queries and transformations in Firestore pipelines.
/// A `Field` can be used to:
/// - Reference a document field by its name or `FieldPath`.
/// - Create complex `BooleanExpression`s for filtering in a `where` clause.
/// - Perform mathematical operations on numeric fields.
/// - Manipulate string and array fields.
///
/// Example of creating a `Field` and using it in a `where` clause:
/// ```swift
/// // Reference the "price" field in a document
/// let priceField = Field("price")
///
/// // Create a query to find products where the price is greater than 100
/// firestore.pipeline()
///   .collection("products")
///   .where(priceField.greaterThan(100))
/// ```
