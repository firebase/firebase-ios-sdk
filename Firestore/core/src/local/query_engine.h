/**
 * Firestore queries can be executed in three modes. The Query Engine determines
 * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines
 * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all
 * implementations.
 *
 * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured
 * any index that can be used to execute query (via SetIndexConfiguration in
 * Firestore/core/src/api/firestore.cc). Otherwise, the engine will try to
 * optimize the query by re-using a previously persisted query result. If that
 * is not possible, the query will be executed via a full collection scan.
 *
 * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine
 * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index
 * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation
 * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all
 * queries that the backend supports.
 *
 * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target
 * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries
 * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query
 * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any
 * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.
 *
 * For queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents, this
 * specific optimization is not guaranteed to produce the same results as full
 * collection scans. So in these cases, query processing falls back to full
 * scans.
