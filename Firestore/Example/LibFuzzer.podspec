# A podspec for libFuzzer. Excludes the 'FuzzerMain.cpp' because the pod
# installation would require the 'LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput' function to be
# linked when the pod is being created, but it will be available in
# the fuzzing application. Hence, users of this Pod are required to
# provide their main function similar to 'FuzzerMain.cpp'.
# See the build script of libFuzzer for more details:
# https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk/lib/fuzzer/build.sh
