/**
 * FSTSpecTests run a set of portable event specifications from JSON spec files against a
 * special isolated version of the Firestore client that allows precise control over when events
 * are delivered. This allows us to test client behavior in a very reliable, deterministic way,
 * including edge cases that would be difficult to reliably reproduce in a full integration test.
 *
 * Both events from user code (adding/removing listens, performing mutations) and events from the
 * Datastore are simulated, while installing as much of the system in between as possible.
 *
 * FSTSpecTests is an abstract base class that must be subclassed to test against a specific local
 * store implementation. To create a new variant of FSTSpecTests:
 *
 * + Subclass FSTSpecTests
 * + override -persistence to create and return an appropriate Persistence implementation.
