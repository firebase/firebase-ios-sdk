# Firestore includes both Objective-C and C++ code, and the Firestore tests
# consist of both XCTest-based tests in Objective-C and GoogleTest-based tests
# in C++. The C++ tests must resolve the classes under test at link time, so
# CocoaPods usual strategy linking Frameworks to the app and then resolving
# those classes through run-time loading does not work in all cases.
#
# If use_frameworks! is disabled above, the project will encounter a ton of
# duplicate Objective-C class warnings during test runs. Some of the tests will
# fail too because duplicate classes also get duplicate static data and this
# violates the expectations of code we depend upon.
#
# The workaround is to strip duplicate dependencies out of the example app,
# which does not need them since it doesn't do anything other than act as a
# host to the tests. This is based on the workaround posted here:
#
#     https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7155
#
# TODO(wilhuff): Reevaluate if this is needed once we require CocoaPods 1.5.1
# which may address this.
