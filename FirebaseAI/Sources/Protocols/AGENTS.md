# FirebaseAI Protocols

This directory contains Swift protocols used throughout the FirebaseAI library.
These protocols define contracts for data models and services, ensuring a consistent and predictable structure.

When adding new features, refer to the existing protocols to maintain consistency.
If a new protocol is needed, define it here.
