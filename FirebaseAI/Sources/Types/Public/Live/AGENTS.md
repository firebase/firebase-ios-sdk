# Gemini Code Assistant

This directory contains public data types for real-time and streaming features of the FirebaseAI library.
These types are used by developers to interact with live, streaming services, such as real-time chat sessions or audio transcription.

### Files:

- **`AudioTranscriptionConfig.swift`**: Defines the `AudioTranscriptionConfig` struct, which is used to enable and configure audio transcriptions when communicating with a model that supports the Gemini Live API.

- **`LiveAudioTranscription.swift`**: Defines the `LiveAudioTranscription` struct, which represents the text transcription of audio during a live interaction with the model.

- **`LiveGenerationConfig.swift`**: Defines the `LiveGenerationConfig` struct, which contains a wide range of configuration options for live content generation, such as `temperature`, `topP`, `topK`, `candidateCount`, `maxOutputTokens`, etc.

- **`LiveGenerativeModel.swift`**: Defines the `LiveGenerativeModel` class, which is a multimodal model capable of real-time content generation based on various input types, supporting bidirectional streaming. Its main function is `connect()`, which starts a `LiveSession`.

- **`LiveServerContent.swift`**: Defines the `LiveServerContent` struct, which represents an incremental server update generated by the model in response to client messages. It includes properties like `modelTurn`, `isTurnComplete`, `wasInterrupted`, etc.

- **`LiveServerGoingAwayNotice.swift`**: Defines the `LiveServerGoingAwayNotice` struct, which is a notification from the server that it will disconnect soon, including the `timeLeft`.

- **`LiveServerMessage.swift`**: Defines the `LiveServerMessage` struct, which represents an update from the server. It contains a `payload` enum that can be content, a tool call, a tool call cancellation, or a going away notice.

- **`LiveServerToolCall.swift`**: Defines the `LiveServerToolCall` struct, which is a request from the server for the client to execute the provided function calls.

- **`LiveServerToolCallCancellation.swift`**: Defines the `LiveServerToolCallCancellation` struct, a notification for the client to cancel a previous function call.

- **`LiveSession.swift`**: Defines the `LiveSession` class, which represents a live WebSocket session. It provides methods for sending real-time data like `sendAudioRealtime(_:)`, `sendVideoRealtime(_:mimeType:)`, `sendTextRealtime(_:)` and also for sending content incrementally with `sendContent(_:turnComplete:)`. It also has a `close()` method to end the session.

- **`LiveSessionErrors.swift`**: Defines several public error structs related to live sessions: `LiveSessionUnsupportedMessageError`, `LiveSessionLostConnectionError`, `LiveSessionUnexpectedClosureError`, and `LiveSessionSetupError`.

- **`SpeechConfig.swift`**: Defines the `SpeechConfig` struct, for controlling the voice of the model during conversation, including the `voiceName` and `languageCode`.
