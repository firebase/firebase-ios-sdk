# FirebaseAI Public Imagen Types

This directory contains public data types for the Imagen image generation feature.
These types are part of the public API and are used by developers to interact with the Imagen service.

### Files

- **`ImagenAspectRatio.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenAspectRatio` struct, which represents the aspect ratio for images generated by Imagen. It provides static properties for common aspect ratios like `square1x1`, `portrait9x16`, etc.

- **`ImagenGenerationConfig.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenGenerationConfig` struct, which contains configuration options for generating images with Imagen, such as `negativePrompt`, `numberOfImages`, `aspectRatio`, `imageFormat`, and `addWatermark`.

- **`ImagenGenerationResponse.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenGenerationResponse` struct, which is the response from a request to generate images. It contains the generated `images` and a `filteredReason` if any images were filtered.

- **`ImagenImageFormat.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenImageFormat` struct, which represents the image format for generated images. It provides static methods for `png()` and `jpeg(compressionQuality:)`.

- **`ImagenImagesBlockedError.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenImagesBlockedError` error, which occurs when image generation fails due to all generated images being blocked.

- **`ImagenInlineImage.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenInlineImage` struct, which represents an image generated by Imagen as inline data. It contains the `mimeType` and the image `data`.

- **`ImagenModel.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenModel` class, which is the main entry point for generating images. It has methods like `generateImages(prompt:)` to generate images from a text prompt.

- **`ImagenPersonFilterLevel.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenPersonFilterLevel` struct, which is a filter level controlling whether generation of images containing people or faces is allowed.

- **`ImagenSafetyFilterLevel.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenSafetyFilterLevel` struct, which is a filter level controlling how aggressively to filter sensitive content.

- **`ImagenSafetySettings.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenSafetySettings` struct, which contains settings for controlling the aggressiveness of filtering out sensitive content, including `safetyFilterLevel` and `personFilterLevel`.
