# FirebaseAI Types

This directory contains data types used in the FirebaseAI library.
These types are organized into `Internal` and `Public` subdirectories.

- **[`Public/`](Public/AGENTS.md)**: Public types are part of the public API of the library and are safe to be used by developers.
- **[`Internal/`](Internal/AGENTS.md)**: Internal types are used for the internal implementation of the library and are not meant for public consumption. They can change at any time without notice.

When adding a new data type, consider whether it should be part of the public API or not and place it in the corresponding directory.
