/// User input that is sent in real time.
///
/// This is different from `ClientContentUpdate` in a few ways:
///
/// - Can be sent continuously without interruption to model generation.
/// - If there is a need to mix data interleaved across the
///   `ClientContentUpdate` and the `RealtimeUpdate`, server attempts to
///   optimize for best response, but there are no guarantees.
/// - End of turn is not explicitly specified, but is rather derived from user
///   activity (for example, end of speech).
/// - Even before the end of turn, the data is processed incrementally
///   to optimize for a fast start of the response from the model.
/// - Is always assumed to be the user's input (cannot be used to populate
///   conversation history).
