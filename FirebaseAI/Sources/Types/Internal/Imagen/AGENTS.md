# FirebaseAI Internal Imagen Types

This directory contains internal data types related to the Imagen feature.
These types are used for constructing requests and parsing responses from the Imagen image generation service.
They are not meant for public consumption and can change at any time.

The types in this directory define the structure of the data sent to and received from the Imagen API, including parameters for image generation, safety attributes, and output options.

### Files

- **`ImageGenerationInstance.swift`**: Defines the `ImageGenerationInstance` struct, which contains a `prompt` string for the image generation.

- **`ImageGenerationOutputOptions.swift`**: Defines the `ImageGenerationOutputOptions` struct, containing `mimeType` and `compressionQuality` for the generated image.

- **`ImageGenerationParameters.swift`**: Defines the `ImageGenerationParameters` struct, which holds all the parameters for an image generation request, such as `sampleCount`, `storageURI`, `negativePrompt`, etc.

- **`ImagenConstants.swift`**: Defines constants for the Imagen feature, including the error domain and specific error codes like `imagesBlocked`.

- **`ImagenGCSImage.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenGCSImage` struct, representing an image generated by Imagen and stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS). It includes the `mimeType` and `gcsURI`.

- **`ImagenGenerationRequest.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenGenerationRequest` struct, which encapsulates the entire request sent to the Imagen API, including the model, API configuration, instances, and parameters.

- **`ImagenImageRepresentable.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenImageRepresentable` protocol for types that can be represented as an Imagen image. This is for internal use.

- **`ImagenSafetyAttributes.swift`**: Defines the `ImagenSafetyAttributes` struct. This is a prediction from Imagen related to safety, but it is currently unused by the SDK.

- **`InternalImagenImage.swift`**: Defines the `_InternalImagenImage` struct, which is the internal representation of an Imagen image, containing the `mimeType`, `bytesBase64Encoded`, and `gcsURI`.

- **`RAIFilteredReason.swift`**: Defines the `RAIFilteredReason` struct, which contains the reason why an image was filtered by Responsible AI (RAI).
