# 11.7.0
- [fixed] Fix Multi-factor session crash on second Firebase app. (#14238)
- [fixed] Updated most decoders to be consistent with Firebase 10's behavior
  for decoding `nil` values. (#14212)

- [fixed] Fix handling of cloud blocking function errors. (#14052)
- [fixed] Fix phone auth flow to skip RCE verification if appVerificationDisabledForTesting is set. (#14242)

  atomic (#14308).

# 11.6.0
- [added] Added reCAPTCHA Enterprise support for app verification during phone
  authentication for Firebase Authentication (#14114)
- [fixed] Restore Firebase 10 behavior by synchronizing access to the
  `Auth.currentUser` API. This resolves some Firebase 11 issues where the
  current user is unexpectedly `nil` at startup.
- [fixed] Restore Firebase 10 decoding behavior to prevent user provider data
  from always being decoded as `nil` . Note that this fix was only needed for
  cases where Firebase 11 was reading data written by Firebase 10. (#14011)
- [fixed] Restore Firebase 10 decoding behavior to prevent user provider data
  from being decoded as `nil` when a user has multiple linked providers. Note
  that this fix was only needed for cases where Firebase 11 was reading data
  written by Firebase 10. Note that this fix will not be in the 11.6.0 zip and
  Carthage distributions, but will be included from 11.6.0 onwards. (#14011)

# 11.5.0
- [fixed] Restore pre-Firebase 11 decoding behavior to prevent users getting
  logged out when upgrading from Firebase 8.10.0 or earlier to Firebase 11.
  Note that this fix will not be in the 11.5.0 zip and Carthage
  distributions, but will be included from 11.6.0 onwards. (#14011)
- [fixed] Restore Firebase 10 keychain error handling behavior when retrieving
  Firebase Auth tokens, potentially causing user sign-out on Firebase 11. Note
  that this fix will not be in the 11.5.0 zip and Carthage distributions, but
  will be included from 11.6.0 onwards. (#14067)

# 11.4.0
- [fixed] Restore Firebase 10 behavior by ignoring `nil` display names used
  during multi factor enrollment. (#13856)
- [fixed] Fix crash when enrolling account with TOTP MFA. (#13880)

  `kSecAttrSynchronizable` key when auth state is set to be shared across
  devices. (#13584)
- [fixed] Prevent a bad memory access crash by using non-ObjC, native Swift
  types in the SDK's networking layer, and moving synchronous work off of
  the shared Swift concurrency queue. (#13650)
- [fixed] Restore Firebase 10 behavior by forwarding errors from interrupted
  reCAPTCHA or OIDC login flows. (#13645)

# 11.2.0
- [fixed] Fixed crashes that could occur in Swift continuation blocks running in the Xcode 16
  betas. (#13480)
- [fixed] Fixed Phone Auth via Sandbox APNS tokens that broke in 11.0.0. (#13479)
- [fixed] Fixed crash when fetching sign in methods due to unexpected nil.
  Previously, fetching sign in methods could return both a `nil` array of sign
  in methods and a `nil` error. In such cases, an empty array is instead
  returned with the `nil` error. (#13550)
- [fixed] Fixed user session persistence in multi tenant projects. Introduced in 11.0.0. (#13565)
- [fixed] Fixed encoding crash that occurs when using TOTP multi-factor
  authentication. Note that this fix will not be in the 11.2.0 zip and Carthage
  distributions, but will be included from 11.3.0 onwards. (#13591)

# 11.1.0
- [fixed] Fixed `Swift.error` conformance for `AuthErrorCode`. (#13430)
- [added] Added custom provider support to `AuthProviderID`. Note that this change will be breaking
  to any code that implemented an exhaustive `switch` on `AuthProviderID` in 11.0.0 - the `switch`
  will need expansion. (#13429)
- [fixed] Fix crash introduced in 11.0.0 in phone authentication flow from
  implicitly unwrapping `nil` error after a token timeout. (#13470)
- [fixed] Objective-C only: `[OAuthProvider getCredentialWithUIDelegate]` was not calling its
  completion handler in the main thread. Regressed in 11.0.0. The fix is only for CocoaPods and
  Swift Package Manager. The zip and Carthage fix will roll out in 11.2.0.
