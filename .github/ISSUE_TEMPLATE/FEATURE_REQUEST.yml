        For large or ambiguous requests, such as significant breaking changes
        or use cases that could be addressed by multiple different features,
        consider instead starting a [Pitch][1] discussion to discuss with
        the Firebase community.

        A good feature request ideally
        * is either immediately obvious (e.g. _Add Sign in with Apple support_), or
        * starts with a use case that is not achievable with the existing
          Firebase API and includes a brief API proposal that would make the use
          case possible.
