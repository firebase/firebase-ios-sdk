### Firebase Messaging Test Apps

We offer two test apps: one in the Sample folder is a simple test app with
the minimum Firebase Messaging code you need to enable delivering
notifications. We kept the code minimal for you to easily debug and compare
the sample code. The one inside the AdvancedSample folder is a test app
based on the test app in the Sample folder. Both Apps share most of the
code in the main target. The AdvancedSample app provides advanced app
extensions features, such as Notification Service Extension, Shared
Extension, App Clips, Live Activities and a watchOS app. The advanced sample app has more
targets than the Sample app and requires your own provisioning profiles and
certificates for each extension target to be setup so that it can be run on
a real device.
