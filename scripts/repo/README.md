# Firebase Apple repo commands

This project includes commands that are too long and complicated to properly
maintain in a bash script, or that have unique option/flag constraints that
are better represented in a swift project.

## Tests

Commands for interacting with integration tests in the repo.

```sh
./scripts/repo.sh tests --help
```
